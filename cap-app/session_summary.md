# Document Extraction System - Development Summary

This document summarizes the development progress on the document extraction system using SAP AI Core with Claude 3.5.

## Latest Developments

In the most recent development session, we implemented the user feedback system and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities:

1. **Feedback Collection**:
   - Added a feedback panel in the UI where users can provide comments on extraction quality
   - Implemented checkboxes for marking problematic fields
   - Added a text area for custom prompt suggestions
   - Created a submitFeedback function to process and send feedback to the server

2. **Feedback Storage**:
   - Implemented a /document/feedback endpoint in express-server.js
   - Created a system for storing feedback in JSON files with unique IDs
   - Built an indexing system to track all feedback entries

3. **RAG Implementation**:
   - Added a feedbackUtils module with functions for finding relevant feedback
   - Implemented document type detection to match with similar past documents
   - Created a system to enhance extraction prompts with previous feedback
   - Added a simple keyword-based similarity search (to be replaced with vector search)

4. **Feedback Debug UI**:
   - Created a feedback-debug.html page to view and explore feedback history
   - Added endpoints to fetch feedback index and individual feedback details
   - Added a navigation link from the main UI to the feedback debug page

5. **Future Chroma DB Integration**:
   - Created RAG_IMPLEMENTATION.md with detailed instructions for adding Chroma DB
   - Designed a modular approach to swap out the keyword search with vector search
   - Provided code samples for implementing the vector database

## Core Features Implemented

1. **Document Upload & Processing**:
   - Upload documents (PDF, JPEG, PNG)
   - Process with SAP AI Core using Claude 3.5
   - Extract structured information (document type, numbers, line items, etc.)

2. **UI Components**:
   - File upload and processing interface
   - Forms for displaying and editing extracted data
   - Confidence indicators for extraction quality
   - Feedback collection panel
   - Debug view for feedback history

3. **Backend Processing**:
   - SAP AI Core integration with Claude 3.5
   - Confidence scoring for extracted fields
   - RAG system for prompt enhancement
   - Feedback storage and retrieval

## Next Steps

1. **Chroma DB Integration**:
   - Implement vector database for semantic similarity search
   - Migrate existing feedback to the vector database
   - Update the RAG system to use vector search

2. **Improve Confidence Indicators**:
   - Add confidence indicators to all fields in the UI
   - Implement visual highlighting based on confidence levels

3. **Advanced RAG Features**:
   - Analyze feedback patterns to identify common extraction issues
   - Create specialized prompts for different document types
   - Implement active learning to prioritize feedback collection

4. **Deployment & CI/CD**:
   - Finalize deployment to SAP BTP Cloud Foundry
   - Set up continuous integration and deployment
   - Create comprehensive deployment documentation

## Architecture

The current system architecture includes:

1. **Frontend**: SAPUI5/Fiori interface using simple-ui5.html
2. **Backend**: Express.js server with SAP CAP compatibility
3. **AI Processing**: SAP AI Core with Claude 3.5
4. **Storage**: File-based storage for documents and feedback
5. **RAG System**: Keyword-based feedback retrieval (to be enhanced with vector search)

The application follows a modular design, allowing for easy replacement of components like the search system when implementing Chroma DB.
