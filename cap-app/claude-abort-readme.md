 Now let's also update the column width to make room for the confidence indicator:

● Update(file_path: app/simple-ui5.html)…
  ⎿  Found 4 matches of the string to replace. For safety, this tool only supports
     replacing exactly one occurrence at a time. Add more lines of context to your edit     
     and try again.

● Let's be more specific with the line number column replacement:

● Update(file_path: app/simple-ui5.html)…
  ⎿  Updated app/simple-ui5.html with 1 addition and 1 removal
     496                                  ],
     497                                  alignItems: "Center"
     498                              }),
     499                              width: "200px",
     499                              width: "220px",
     500                              minWidth: 150
     501                          }),
     502                          new sap.ui.table.Column({

● Perfect! Now, when you upload a document, you should see:

  1. A confidence indicator next to the Document Type field in the Document Information     
   section
  2. A confidence indicator next to each Item Number in the Line Items table

  The confidence indicators will show:
  - Green checkmark for high confidence (≥90%)
  - Yellow/orange warning for medium confidence (≥70%, <90%)
  - Red error icon for low confidence (<70%)
  - With a percentage value next to the icon

  This visual cue will help users identify which fields might need manual verification      
  or correction based on the model's confidence in its extraction.

  You can continue applying this pattern to other fields gradually as needed. Would you     
   like me to prepare code for adding confidence indicators to any other specific
  fields next time?

> is the confidence level default 100 returned by LLM ?

● The confidence level isn't a default 100% returned by the LLM. The confidence scores      
  are generated by Claude 3.5 based on its own assessment of how certain it is about        
  each extraction.

  When we request confidence scores in our prompt:
  Additionally, I need you to include a confidence score for each extracted field. Add      
  a parallel structure called "confidence"...

  Claude analyzes several factors to determine its confidence for each field:
  1. Image quality/clarity of the text
  2. Ambiguity in the data format
  3. Consistency with expected patterns
  4. How well it can see and interpret the text
  5. Presence of conflicting information

  Claude assigns different confidence values to different fields. For example:
  - Fields with very clear, standard formatting (like a document number in large bold       
  text) might get 0.95-0.99
  - Fields that are partially obscured or in unusual formats might get 0.70-0.85
  - Fields that are hard to read or highly ambiguous might get 0.40-0.65

  These confidence scores are the model's own assessment of its extraction accuracy.        
  They're quite useful because they give us insight into which fields the model is
  uncertain about, allowing us to prioritize our manual verification efforts.

  If you're consistently seeing very high scores (like 100% or 0.99 across all fields),     
   that's unusual and might indicate the model is being overconfident. Typically, the       
  model should show varying confidence levels across different fields depending on the      
  quality and clarity of each piece of information in the document.

> ok good, lets include the confidence scores for other fields later, now lets add a        
  small comments/feedback section in the UI that the user can provide to provide
  feedback that the LLM can use to learn and correct itself next time when it does the      
  extractiion. do you think this is possible? and what will the logic be to implement       
  this? just explain the concept on how to ahieve it and then we will decide whether to     
   procceed with this implementation

✻ Thinking…

  This is an excellent request for implementing human-in-the-loop feedback for the LLM 
  extraction system. Let me outline a concept for adding user feedback to improve 
  future extractions.

  The conceptual flow would be:
  1. User sees extraction results with confidence scores
  2. User identifies errors or provides feedback on specific fields
  3. System captures this feedback
  4. Feedback is incorporated into future extraction prompts or used to fine-tune the       
  model

  There are a few approaches we could take:

  Approach 1: Prompt-Based Learning
  - Add a feedback section to the UI where users can comment on extraction quality
  - Store feedback along with the original document and extraction results
  - Use this feedback to improve future prompts by including examples of past 
  corrections
  - This approach doesn't require model fine-tuning but can improve extraction through      
  better prompting

  Approach 2: Supervised Fine-Tuning
  - Collect user corrections as labeled training data
  - Periodically use this data to fine-tune the model (requires API access for 
  fine-tuning)
  - More complex but potentially more effective for long-term improvement

  Approach 3: Hybrid Adaptive Prompting
  - Store user feedback and corrections
  - Dynamically modify prompts for future extractions based on past errors
  - Include document-specific context in prompts when extracting similar documents

  Let me outline the specific UI and implementation concepts for Approach 1, which is       
  the most feasible:

● Implementing User Feedback for LLM Extraction

  This is an excellent idea! Adding a feedback mechanism would create a
  human-in-the-loop system that can continuously improve. Here's a concept for
  implementation:

  Conceptual Design

  1. UI Components

  - Add a feedback panel at the bottom of each section (Document Info, Vendor Info,
  Line Items)
  - Include:
    - Text area for general comments
    - Option to mark specific fields as incorrect
    - Button to submit feedback

  2. Data Flow

  - Store feedback with the original document and extraction results in your database       
  - Use feedback to enhance future extractions
  - Create a feedback loop that improves extraction quality over time

  3. Implementation Approaches

  Option A: Prompt Enhancement (Easier)
  - Store user feedback with document examples
  - Incorporate past corrections into future prompts
  - Example: "Previous extractions of similar invoices mistook the order number for the     
   invoice number. Pay special attention to distinguishing these fields."

  Option B: Few-Shot Learning (Medium)
  - When extracting a new document, find similar documents with corrections
  - Include these as examples in the prompt
  - Example: "Here's a similar document where the correct extraction was: {...}"

  Option C: Model Fine-Tuning (Advanced)
  - Collect user corrections as training data
  - Periodically fine-tune the model on these corrections
  - Requires API access for fine-tuning and more infrastructure

  Technical Implementation (Option A)

  1. Database Schema:
    - Add feedback table related to documents
    - Store field-specific corrections and general comments
  2. UI Components:
    - Add a collapsible feedback section
    - Include field-specific checkboxes for marking errors
    - Provide text area for detailed feedback
  3. Feedback Processing:
    - Create API endpoint to receive and store feedback
    - Associate feedback with specific document types/structures
    - Build a feedback repository
  4. Enhanced Extraction:
    - Before extraction, retrieve relevant past feedback
    - Modify the prompt to include common correction patterns
    - Add specific instructions based on document similarity

  Sample UI Integration

  You could add a feedback section like:

  <sap.m.Panel headerText="Provide Feedback">
      <sap.m.TextArea placeholder="Comment on extraction quality..." rows="3"
  width="100%"/>
      <sap.m.CheckBox text="Mark fields with errors"/>
      <sap.m.Button text="Submit Feedback" type="Emphasized"/>
  </sap.m.Panel>

  This approach creates a continuous improvement loop where human feedback makes the AI     
   extraction better over time, especially for document types it regularly processes.       

  Would you like me to start implementing this feedback mechanism in your application?      

> how is option b different from A? the user still has to provide the inputright?

● You're right to question the distinction - let me clarify the difference between
  Options A and B:

  Option A: Prompt Enhancement

  - Uses general patterns from feedback (not specific documents)
  - Creates general rules based on aggregated feedback
  - Example prompt addition: "Pay special attention to tax field positioning - users        
  often report it being confused with shipping costs"
  - Doesn't reference specific past documents

  Option B: Few-Shot Learning

  - Uses specific similar documents as examples
  - Shows the model exactly how to extract from similar layouts
  - Example prompt addition: "Here's a similar invoice from the same vendor where the       
  correct extraction was {specific example with correct fields}"
  - System automatically finds similar documents and uses them as explicit examples

  The key difference is:
  - Option A creates general rules from feedback
  - Option B shows specific example documents and their correct extractions

  In both cases, users provide feedback, but how that feedback is used differs:

  - Option A turns feedback into general guidelines
  - Option B stores complete corrected examples and retrieves similar ones for the
  model to learn from

  Option B can be more powerful but requires:
  1. Document similarity matching algorithm
  2. Storage of complete corrected documents
  3. More complex prompt construction with examples

  Think of Option A as "here are general rules to follow" versus Option B as "here's        
  how you correctly extracted a very similar document last time."

> so option B would require a vector store?

● Exactly! Option B would benefit greatly from a vector store. Here's how it would
  work:

  Option B with Vector Storage

  1. Vector Embedding:
    - Convert each document into a vector representation using embeddings
    - Store these vectors along with the corrected extraction results
    - Embeddings capture the semantic and structural properties of documents
  2. Similarity Search:
    - When a new document arrives, generate its vector embedding
    - Query the vector store to find the most similar documents
    - Retrieve the top 2-3 most similar documents with their corrected extractions
  3. Enhanced Prompting:
    - Include these similar examples in the prompt to Claude
    - Format as: "Here's a similar document and its correct extraction: {example}"
    - This gives Claude specific examples to learn from
  4. Vector Database Options:
    - Pinecone: Purpose-built vector database with simple API
    - Weaviate: Open-source vector search engine
    - Chroma DB: Lightweight embedding database for AI applications
    - Milvus: Open-source vector database for similarity search
    - Qdrant: Vector search engine focused on production readiness

  The vector store approach has several advantages:
  - More accurate retrieval of truly similar documents
  - Better handling of document layout and structure similarity
  - Ability to find similar documents even with different content but same template
  - More efficient search than traditional databases for this use case

  This is essentially a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach applied to
  document extraction, where you're augmenting the LLM's capabilities with retrieved        
  similar examples it can learn from.

  Would this vector-based approach fit with your technical architecture?

> yes RAG would fit, but is chroma db free and what is its limit terms of storage?

● Yes, Chroma DB is a good choice for your RAG implementation. Here's what you need to      
  know:

  Chroma DB Details

  Licensing and Cost:
  - Chroma DB is completely free and open-source
  - Released under the Apache 2.0 license
  - No licensing fees for commercial use

  Storage Limits:
  - No hard-coded limits on database size
  - Practical limits depend on your hardware resources
  - Typically handles hundreds of thousands to millions of embeddings efficiently on        
  standard hardware

  Resource Requirements:
  - Memory: Primary constraint (vectors are loaded into memory)
  - For 100K documents: ~1-2GB RAM depending on embedding size
  - For 1M documents: ~10-20GB RAM

  Deployment Options:
  1. In-memory: Simplest setup, vectors stored in memory only
  2. PersistentClient: Saves data to disk, allowing persistence between restarts
  3. Docker container: Isolated deployment for production use

  Key Benefits for Your Project:
  - Simple Python API that's easy to integrate
  - Works well for document similarity in RAG applications
  - No additional infrastructure required for getting started
  - Can be upgraded to more robust solutions if needed later

  Sample Code to Integrate:
  import chromadb

  # Create a persistent client
  client = chromadb.PersistentClient(path="./chroma_db")

  # Create a collection for document embeddings
  collection = client.create_collection("document_extractions")

  # Add documents with their corrected data
  collection.add(
      documents=["Invoice content text..."],
      metadatas=[{"corrected_data": json.dumps(corrected_extraction)}],
      ids=["doc1"]
  )

  # Query for similar documents when processing new ones
  results = collection.query(
      query_texts=["New invoice content..."],
      n_results=3
  )

  For your specific application, Chroma DB should handle thousands of document examples     
   without issue. You could start with it for your feedback loop implementation, and if     
   you eventually outgrow it, migration to larger-scale vector databases like Pinecone      
  or Weaviate is straightforward.

  Does this align with what you're looking for in terms of capabilities and
  constraints?

> ok, lets implement this. lets first build the UI aspect where the user will proide        
  the zero shot prompt

● Great! Let's implement the UI for users to provide feedback that will enhance our
  extraction capabilities. We'll build a feedback panel that allows users to:

  1. Provide general comments about the extraction
  2. Specify fields that were incorrectly extracted
  3. Submit the feedback for storage and future use
